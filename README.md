# IPL_SQL_Project

## Overview


This project involves analyzing cricket statistics data over the past three years(2023,2022,2021) to derive insights into player and team performance across various metrics including runs scored, batting averages, strike rates, wickets taken, bowling averages, economy rates, boundary percentages, and more.

## DataSets
Create a database called Ipl


Create 4 tables with [dataset](https://github.com/Tamil-Selvan-R/IPL_2024_SQL_Project/tree/main/DataSet)

## Analysis Tasks


1. [Top 10 Batsmen by Total Runs](https://github.com/Tamil-Selvan-R/IPL_2024_SQL_Project/blob/main/ipl%20pics/Sql-Project-1st.png): Identifies batsmen with the highest total runs scored over the past three years.
2. [Top 10 Batsmen by Batting Average](https://github.com/Tamil-Selvan-R/IPL_2024_SQL_Project/blob/main/ipl%20pics/Sql-Project-2nd.png): Lists batsmen with the highest batting average (minimum 60 balls faced in each season).
3. [Top 10 Batsmen by Strike Rate](https://github.com/Tamil-Selvan-R/IPL_2024_SQL_Project/blob/main/ipl%20pics/Sql-Project-3rd.png): Identifies batsmen with the highest strike rates (minimum 60 balls faced in each season).
4. [Top 10 Bowlers by Total Wickets](https://github.com/Tamil-Selvan-R/IPL_2024_SQL_Project/blob/main/ipl%20pics/Sql-Project-4th.png): Lists bowlers with the highest total wickets taken over the past three years.
5. [Top 10 Bowlers by Bowling Average](https://github.com/Tamil-Selvan-R/IPL_2024_SQL_Project/blob/main/ipl%20pics/Sql-Project-5th.png): Identifies bowlers with the lowest bowling averages (minimum 60 balls bowled in each season).
6. [Top 10 Bowlers by Economy Rate](https://github.com/Tamil-Selvan-R/IPL_2024_SQL_Project/blob/main/ipl%20pics/Sql-Project-6th.png): Lists bowlers with the lowest economy rates (minimum 60 balls bowled in each season).
7. [Top 5 Batsmen by Boundary Percentage](https://github.com/Tamil-Selvan-R/IPL_2024_SQL_Project/blob/main/ipl%20pics/Sql-Project-7th.png): Identifies batsmen with the highest percentage of runs from boundaries (fours and sixes).
8. [Top 4 Teams by Winning Percentage](https://github.com/Tamil-Selvan-R/IPL_2024_SQL_Project/blob/main/ipl%20pics/Sql-Project-8th.png): Lists teams with the highest winning percentages based on matches played and won.
9. [Top 2 Teams by Wins Chasing Targets](https://github.com/Tamil-Selvan-R/IPL_2024_SQL_Project/blob/main/ipl%20pics/Sql-Project-9th.png): Identifies teams with the highest number of wins achieved by chasing targets.
10. [Top 5 Bowlers by Dot Ball Percentage](https://github.com/Tamil-Selvan-R/IPL_2024_SQL_Project/blob/main/ipl%20pics/Sql-Project-10th.png): Lists bowlers with the highest percentage of dot balls bowled.


## SQL Techniques Used

**Common Table Expressions (CTEs):**
  Used to define temporary result sets for aggregation and filtering.

**Aggregate Functions:**
  SUM, COUNT, and AVG used extensively to calculate totals and averages.
  
**Joins:**
  Inner joins used to link match details with batting and bowling statistics.
  
**Subqueries:**
  Utilized for filtering and conditional aggregations.


## Project Structure


1. SQL Scripts: Contains SQL queries used for data extraction, transformation, and analysis.
2. Database: Details the structure of the database schema used for this analysis.
3. Results: Output of the top performers for each category based on SQL queries.


## Conclusion

The project successfully analyzed cricket statistics to highlight top performers across batting, bowling, and team performance metrics over the past three years. It provides valuable insights into player and team dynamics based on statistical data.
